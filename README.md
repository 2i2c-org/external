# The 2i2c Planning Repository

This is a lightweight repository to facilitate planning deliverables and tasks for projects that do not have a natural repository inside of 2i2c.

Its primary use it to hold issues that point to other open source projects, so that we may keep track of them in our workflows more effectively.

It is meant to be used in conjunction with the [team workflow described here](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/practices/coordination.html).

# Guidelines for use

**Use Project Labels**. Each issue in this repository should have a **Project Label**.
These are labels structured like `proj: <project-name>`.
The project label helps us know where else an issue refers to, and helps team members filter and sort them in our project boards.

**Cross-link to open source projects**. For issues that refer to actions to take in other open source projects, make sure to include a link in your issue that points to where discussion / tracking is happening elsewhere.
In general, we don't want this repository to contain too much information, just labels to help us organize, and pointers to other repositories where the action is happening.
